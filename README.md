## Project Overview
# Market Impact 
# Implementation
- Web scraping algorithms reliably find key product content (photos, price, colour, dimensions)
- LLMs enhance and structure the scraped content, into a JSON object
- Product is rendered on the frontend using HTML and IMGs. User can plan layout accurately with real, to-scale products
- Screenshot of floorplan can be sent to GPT for item suggestions, layout review and budgeting
